**Last Updated:** October 20, 2025

## Why This Project Exists

MessageAI is being built as an MVP for a messaging platform that will eventually incorporate AI-powered features. The MVP phase focuses entirely on **reliable messaging infrastructure** before any AI capabilities are added.

---

## Problems We're Solving

### Primary Problem
Users need a reliable, real-time messaging application that works seamlessly across different network conditions and handles offline scenarios gracefully.

### Specific Pain Points Addressed

1. **Message Reliability**
   - Messages must never be lost, even during poor network conditions
   - Offline messages queue locally and sync automatically when connection returns

2. **Real-Time Communication**
   - Messages appear within 2 seconds for online recipients
   - Typing indicators and presence make conversations feel natural

3. **Conversation Context**
   - All messages persist locally for instant access
   - Chat history survives app restarts
   - Group conversations support multi-user collaboration

4. **Communication Awareness**
   - Users know when messages are delivered and read
   - Online/offline status prevents messaging unavailable users
   - Typing indicators provide natural conversation flow

## How It Should Work

### User Experience Flow

**New User Onboarding:**
1. Sign up with email/phone
2. Choose display name
3. Upload profile picture (or use default)
4. Start messaging

**Core Messaging Experience:**
1. View conversation list (sorted by most recent)
2. Tap conversation to open chat
3. See full message history instantly (loaded from local database)
4. Send messages with immediate optimistic UI update
5. See status change: sending → sent → delivered → read
6. Receive real-time messages from other users
7. See when other user is typing
8. Know when other user is online/offline

**Offline Experience:**
1. User loses network connection
2. Can still send messages (queued locally)
3. Messages show "Waiting to send..." status
4. When connection returns, all queued messages send automatically
5. No user intervention required

**Group Chat Experience:**
1. Create group with 3+ participants
2. All members see messages in real-time
3. Clear attribution showing who sent each message
4. Delivery/read tracking per participant

## User Experience Goals

### Performance Targets
- **Message delivery:** <2 seconds for online recipients
- **App launch:** Chat list appears instantly (from local storage)
- **Optimistic UI:** Messages appear immediately before server confirmation
- **Presence updates:** Online/offline status updates within 5 seconds

### User Expectations
- **Reliability:** Messages never lost, even in poor network conditions
- **Transparency:** Always know message status (sending, sent, delivered, read)
- **Natural feel:** Typing indicators make conversations feel real
- **No friction:** Offline queueing happens automatically

### Quality Standards
- No critical bugs that break core messaging flow
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- Loading states for all async operations
- Empty states guide users when no content exists

## What Success Looks Like

**Day 1 Success (MVP Checkpoint):**
- Two users can install the app and chat in real-time
- Messages persist through force-quit and reopen
- Offline scenario works: airplane mode → send messages → reconnect → messages deliver
- Group chat with 3+ users functional
- Read receipts and online status working

**Beyond MVP:**
- AI-powered thread summarization
- Smart reply suggestions
- Message translation
- Context-aware assistance

## Design Principles

1. **Reliability First:** Core messaging must be bulletproof before adding features
2. **Offline-First:** App should work seamlessly without network
3. **Real-Time Sync:** Changes propagate immediately to all participants
4. **Optimistic UI:** Don't wait for server confirmation to update UI
5. **Progressive Enhancement:** Start simple, add complexity incrementally

---

## Key Metrics (Post-Launch)

- Message delivery success rate (target: 99.9%)
- Average message latency (target: <2 seconds)
- Offline sync success rate (target: 100%)
- App crash rate (target: <0.1%)
- User retention (future metric)
