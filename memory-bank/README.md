## About This Memory Bank

This Memory Bank serves as the complete knowledge base for the MessageAI International Communicator project. Since AI context resets between sessions, these documents ensure continuity and provide all necessary context to resume work at any time.

**MessageAI** is now a fully-functional international messaging app with 14 AI-powered features including real-time translation, cultural context, smart replies, image OCR, pronunciation guide, and more.

## How to Use This Memory Bank

### Starting a New Session
1. Read `activeContext.md` - Know where we are
2. Read `progress.md` - Know what's done
3. Review relevant rule files for the feature you're working on
4. Begin work

### During Development
- Reference `systemPatterns.md` for architecture decisions
- Reference `techContext.md` for implementation details
- Reference `.cursor/rules/` for specific patterns
- Keep code consistent with established patterns

### After Completing Work
1. Update `activeContext.md` with what changed
2. Update `progress.md` with completion status
3. Update other files if architecture or patterns changed
4. Document new patterns in `.cursor/rules/` if discovered

### When Stuck
1. Check `systemPatterns.md` for established patterns
2. Check `.cursor/rules/` for specific guidance
3. Check `techContext.md` for technical constraints
4. Review `projectbrief.md` to stay aligned with goals
