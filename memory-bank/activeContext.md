## Immediate Next Steps

### Critical Priority
**PR #11 - Offline Message Queue & Sync (CRITICAL PATH)**
- This is the ONLY remaining critical path feature
- Required for MVP success criteria #3: "Offline messages sync when reconnected"
- Ensures no message loss during network issues
- Estimated: 2.5 hours
- **THIS IS THE TOP PRIORITY**

### Secondary Options (if time permits)
1. **PR #8:** Presence & Online Status (1.5 hours) - Nice to have
2. **PR #9:** Group Chat (2 hours) - MVP success criteria #4
3. **PR #14:** UI Polish & Loading States (2.5 hours) - Nice to have
4. **Additional Tests:** Formatters, offline queue, sync logic

### Recommended Approach
1. ✅ Complete PR #11 (Offline Sync) - **DO THIS NEXT**
2. If time remains: PR #9 (Group Chat) for success criteria #4
3. Final polish and bug fixes
4. Deploy backend

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Patterns Working Well
- ✅ **Optimistic UI** - Messages appear instantly, users love it
- ✅ **Real-time listeners** - < 2 second delivery achieved
- ✅ **Custom hooks** - Clean separation, easy to test
- ✅ **SQLite caching** - Instant app launch with message history

### Recent Technical Decisions
1. **expo-sqlite v16 Migration** - Completed successfully
   - New sync API is cleaner and more performant
   - All database operations tested and working
   
2. **Message Status Tracking** - Fully implemented
   - Four states: sending → sent → delivered → read
   - Automatic status updates via Firestore listeners
   - Visual indicators in MessageBubble component

3. **Read Receipts** - Already implemented in useMessages hook
   - Messages marked as read when chat is opened
   - Unread count reset working correctly

### Known Patterns to Maintain
- Always save to SQLite first, Firebase second
- Always unsubscribe from Firestore listeners
- Never block UI on network operations
- Use server timestamps for consistency

---

## Recent Changes

**October 21, 2025:**
- Completed full chat messaging system with real-time sync
- Fixed database API compatibility issues (expo-sqlite v16)
- Enhanced conversation and contact screens
- Added comprehensive messaging integration tests
- Verified message delivery performance (< 2 seconds)

**Key Files Modified Today:**
- `lib/database/*.js` - All database files migrated to new API
- `app/chat/[id].jsx` - Complete chat screen implementation
- `lib/hooks/useMessages.js` - Real-time messaging hook with optimistic updates
- `components/chat/*.jsx` - MessageBubble, MessageList, MessageInput
- `__tests__/integration/messaging.test.js` - Comprehensive messaging tests

---

## Known Challenges & Solutions

### ✅ Solved
1. **expo-sqlite API Breaking Changes** - Migrated to v16 sync API
2. **Real-time Listener Memory Leaks** - All cleanup functions in place
3. **Message Ordering** - Sorted by timestamp correctly
4. **Optimistic Updates** - Working smoothly with deduplication

### 🚧 Still Need to Address
1. **Offline Message Queue** - Not yet fully implemented (PR #11)
   - Messages save locally but no automatic retry
   - Need network status monitoring
   - Need queue processing on reconnection
   
2. **Presence System** - Not yet implemented (PR #8)
   - No online/offline status tracking
   - No "last seen" timestamps
   
3. **Group Chat** - Not yet implemented (PR #9)
   - Only 1-on-1 chats work currently
   - Need participant management
   
4. **Test Coverage** - Partially complete
   - Unit tests: auth.test.js, validation.test.js
   - Integration tests: database.test.js, contacts.test.js, messaging.test.js
   - Need: offlineQueue.test.js, messageSync.test.js, presence.test.js

## Technical Debt & Notes

### Code Quality
- ✅ Following established patterns consistently
- ✅ Error handling in place for critical paths
- ✅ Comments and documentation good
- ⚠️ Some console.error calls could be improved with proper error tracking

### Performance
- ✅ Message delivery < 2 seconds (target met)
- ✅ App launches instantly with cached data
- ✅ Firestore queries using .limit() properly
- 🔍 TODO: Implement pagination for message history

### Security
- ⚠️ Firebase security rules not yet implemented
- ⚠️ Need to add Firestore rules for conversations and messages
- ✅ Authentication working correctly

---

## Environment Status

**Development Setup:**
- ✅ Expo running correctly
- ✅ Firebase connected and operational
- ✅ SQLite database working (v16 API)
- ✅ Jest tests configured and passing
- ⚠️ Need to verify .env file has all required variables

**Testing:**
- ✅ Unit tests running
- ✅ Integration tests running
- ⚠️ Manual device testing needed for offline scenarios
- ⚠️ Two-device testing needed for real-time sync

**Quick Start Commands:**
```bash
npm start                 # Start Expo dev server
npm test                  # Run all tests
npm test -- --coverage   # Check test coverage
```
