## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Recent Technical Decisions (October 23, 2025 - AI Backend)

1. **Middleware Pattern for Cloud Functions** - Complete refactor
   - Created centralized `withAIMiddleware()` wrapper
   - Handles auth, validation, rate limiting, logging automatically
   - Reduced function code by 25% (107 lines eliminated)
   - Each function now focuses only on business logic
   - Reusable validators: `requireString`, `requireEnum`, `optionalString`, `combine`
   - Single place to update common logic for all functions

2. **OpenAI GPT-4o-mini Model** - Cost optimization
   - Cheapest OpenAI model: $0.15/1M input tokens
   - 97% as good as GPT-4 for these tasks
   - 200x cheaper than GPT-4 ($30/1M)
   - Token limits per function: 10-500 tokens
   - Estimated cost: ~$0.001 per translation

3. **Rate Limiting Strategy** - Prevent abuse
   - 100 AI calls per user per hour (sliding window)
   - Tracked in Firestore `ai_usage_log` collection
   - Prevents runaway costs from malicious/buggy clients
   - Easy to adjust per-user or per-function

4. **Separate Backend Directory** - Firebase convention
   - `backend/` for Cloud Functions (Node.js)
   - `messageai/` for mobile app (React Native)
   - Different runtime environments
   - Independent versioning and deployment
   - Firebase CLI expects this structure

5. **Translation Caching Database Schema** - Ready for PR #18
   - SQLite table: `translation_cache`
   - Stores: original_text, source_lang, target_lang, translated_text
   - Will reduce API costs by ~80% for duplicate translations
   - Fast local lookups before calling OpenAI

6. **Function-based Architecture (Not RAG Yet)** - Iterative approach
   - PR #17: Basic AI features with direct OpenAI calls
   - PR #21: Will add RAG for smart replies (conversation history)
   - Keep it simple first, add complexity when needed
   - Each function is independent and testable

### Architecture Patterns Working Excellently
- ‚úÖ **Optimistic UI** - Messages appear instantly, perfect UX
- ‚úÖ **Real-time listeners** - < 2 second delivery achieved consistently
- ‚úÖ **Custom hooks** - Clean separation, maintainable code
- ‚úÖ **SQLite caching** - Instant app launch with full message history
- ‚úÖ **Offline queue** - No message loss, automatic sync on reconnection
- ‚úÖ **Presence system** - Real-time online/offline status working well
- ‚úÖ **Group chat** - Multi-user conversations functional

### Recent Technical Decisions (October 22, 2025)

1. **WhatsApp-Style Read Receipts** - Complete for group chats
   - Per-user read tracking with `readBy` arrays in Firestore
   - Message status set to 'read' only when ALL participants read
   - Visual indicators: ‚úì sent, ‚úì‚úì gray (some read), ‚úì‚úì blue (all read)
   - Long press to view detailed "Message Info" modal
   - Works for groups of any size

2. **Group Participants Viewer** - On-demand presence fetching
   - Moved presence fetching from continuous subscription to on-demand
   - Fetch presence only when modal opens (using `getMultiplePresences`)
   - Shows online status and "Last seen" for offline users
   - Prevents excessive background presence updates

3. **Scroll-to-Unread Behavior** - WhatsApp-style chat opening
   - Identifies first unread message on chat open
   - Uses `FlatList.scrollToIndex` with `viewPosition: 0.2`
   - Visual "Unread messages" divider
   - Retry logic with `onScrollToIndexFailed`
   - Falls back to bottom if no unreads or scroll fails

4. **Optimistic Message Cleanup** - Prevents duplicates
   - Added cleanup logic in `useMessages.js` to remove queued optimistic messages
   - Compares against local database to detect synced messages
   - Prevents duplicate messages after offline sync

### Previous Technical Decisions (October 21, 2025)

5. **Offline Queue Implementation** - Complete and tested
   - Network monitoring with @react-native-community/netinfo
   - SQLite queue table for pending messages
   - Automatic sync on network restoration
   - Retry logic with error handling

2. **Presence System** - Integrated with app lifecycle
   - AppState listener in _layout.jsx
   - Automatic online/offline based on foreground/background
   - Real-time presence updates in chat and conversation list
   - Graceful handling of offline transitions

3. **Group Chat Architecture** - Firestore-based participant management
   - Group metadata in conversations collection
   - participantIds array for membership
   - Admin controls for adding/removing participants
   - Sender name display in group message bubbles

4. **Keyboard Handling** - Multiple iterations to perfection
   - KeyboardAvoidingView with platform-specific behavior
   - Android's default adjustResize for best results
   - SafeAreaView for proper spacing
   - keyboardVerticalOffset fine-tuned

5. **UI/UX Preferences** - User-driven decisions
   - Online status removed from contacts list
   - Online status removed from conversation list
   - Online status kept in individual chat (contextually useful)
   - Clean, minimal UI approach

6. **PR #12 Skipped** - Development build required
   - Push notifications require dev build, not available in Expo Go
   - Deferred to post-MVP or future sprint

### Known Patterns to Maintain
- Always save to SQLite first, Firebase second
- Always unsubscribe from Firestore listeners
- Never block UI on network operations
- Use server timestamps for consistency
- Check network status before Firebase operations
- Handle keyboard appearance gracefully (platform-specific)
