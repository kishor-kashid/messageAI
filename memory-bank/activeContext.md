# Active Context: MessageAI MVP

**Last Updated:** October 20, 2025  
**Current Phase:** Pre-Development / Planning Complete  
**Next Milestone:** PR #1 - Project Setup

---

## Current Status

**Phase:** Planning and Memory Bank Initialization  
**Progress:** 0% (No code written yet)  
**Timeline:** 24 hours remaining until Tuesday deadline

---

## What We Just Did

1. ✅ Created comprehensive PRD (`messageai-prd.md`)
2. ✅ Created detailed task breakdown (`messageai-task-list.md`)
3. ✅ Analyzed project requirements and scope
4. ✅ Initialized Memory Bank structure
5. ✅ Set up `.cursor/rules/` directory for project intelligence

---

## Current Work Focus

**Immediate Next Steps:**
1. Start PR #1: Project Setup & Firebase Configuration
2. Initialize Expo project with JavaScript template
3. Install dependencies (Firebase, SQLite, Notifications, etc.)
4. Configure Firebase project in Firebase Console
5. Set up basic folder structure
6. Configure Jest for testing

---

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technology Choices Made
- **Platform:** React Native + Expo (chosen for rapid development)
- **Language:** JavaScript (not TypeScript) for faster iteration
- **Backend:** Firebase (zero infrastructure setup, real-time built-in)
- **Local Storage:** Expo SQLite (offline persistence)
- **Testing:** Jest + React Native Testing Library

### Why These Choices?
- 24-hour timeline demands fastest possible development
- Expo allows instant testing via Expo Go
- Firebase provides real-time sync and offline support out of the box
- SQLite handles local message persistence

### Trade-offs Accepted
- **Firebase vendor lock-in** → Accept for MVP speed
- **No TypeScript** → Faster iteration, less type checking overhead
- **Foreground notifications only** → Simpler implementation
- **No AI features in MVP** → Focus on messaging reliability first

---

## Recent Changes

- **Initial Planning:** Completed comprehensive PRD and task breakdown
- **Memory Bank:** Just initialized (this is the first version)

---

## Known Challenges Ahead

1. **Time Constraint:** 24 hours is aggressive for full MVP
2. **Real-time Sync Complexity:** Need to handle race conditions carefully
3. **Offline Queue Logic:** Must ensure no message loss during network issues
4. **Testing Coverage:** Need to write tests while developing (target >70%)
5. **Memory Leak Risk:** Must properly unsubscribe from Firebase listeners

---

## Current Questions/Uncertainties

1. **Device Testing:** How many physical devices available for testing?
2. **Firebase Limits:** Will free tier be sufficient for development/testing?
3. **Test Environment:** Should we use Firebase emulator or live Firebase?

---

## Next Actions (In Order)

### PR #1 Tasks (Est. 1 hour)
1. Run `npx create-expo-app messageai-mvp --template blank`
2. Install all dependencies (Firebase, SQLite, etc.)
3. Configure Jest for testing
4. Create Firebase project in Firebase Console
5. Add Firebase config to app
6. Create complete folder structure
7. Test Firebase connection

### After PR #1
- Move to PR #2: Authentication System
- Begin implementing auth context and screens
- Write unit tests for authentication functions

---

## Priority Reminders

**If time runs short, focus on:**
- ✅ PRs #1-3, #6 (Setup, Auth, Database, Messaging) - CRITICAL
- ✅ PR #11 (Offline Sync) - HIGH PRIORITY
- ⚠️ PRs #7-10 (Indicators, Presence, Groups, Media) - NICE TO HAVE

**Testing Priority:**
- Unit tests for auth, validation, offline queue, sync, formatters
- Integration tests for database, contacts, messaging, presence

---

## Context for Next Session

When resuming work:
1. Check `progress.md` for latest completion status
2. Review which PR we're currently on
3. Check for any blockers or bugs discovered
4. Review test results and coverage

This active context will be updated after each significant milestone or when important decisions are made.
