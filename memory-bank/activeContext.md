## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Patterns Working Excellently
- ‚úÖ **Optimistic UI** - Messages appear instantly, perfect UX
- ‚úÖ **Real-time listeners** - < 2 second delivery achieved consistently
- ‚úÖ **Custom hooks** - Clean separation, maintainable code
- ‚úÖ **SQLite caching** - Instant app launch with full message history
- ‚úÖ **Offline queue** - No message loss, automatic sync on reconnection
- ‚úÖ **Presence system** - Real-time online/offline status working well
- ‚úÖ **Group chat** - Multi-user conversations functional

### Recent Technical Decisions (October 21, 2025)

1. **Offline Queue Implementation** - Complete and tested
   - Network monitoring with @react-native-community/netinfo
   - SQLite queue table for pending messages
   - Automatic sync on network restoration
   - Retry logic with error handling

2. **Presence System** - Integrated with app lifecycle
   - AppState listener in _layout.jsx
   - Automatic online/offline based on foreground/background
   - Real-time presence updates in chat and conversation list
   - Graceful handling of offline transitions

3. **Group Chat Architecture** - Firestore-based participant management
   - Group metadata in conversations collection
   - participantIds array for membership
   - Admin controls for adding/removing participants
   - Sender name display in group message bubbles

4. **Keyboard Handling** - Multiple iterations to perfection
   - KeyboardAvoidingView with platform-specific behavior
   - Android's default adjustResize for best results
   - SafeAreaView for proper spacing
   - keyboardVerticalOffset fine-tuned

5. **UI/UX Preferences** - User-driven decisions
   - Online status removed from contacts list
   - Online status removed from conversation list
   - Online status kept in individual chat (contextually useful)
   - Clean, minimal UI approach

6. **PR #12 Skipped** - Development build required
   - Push notifications require dev build, not available in Expo Go
   - Deferred to post-MVP or future sprint

### Known Patterns to Maintain
- Always save to SQLite first, Firebase second
- Always unsubscribe from Firestore listeners
- Never block UI on network operations
- Use server timestamps for consistency
- Check network status before Firebase operations
- Handle keyboard appearance gracefully (platform-specific)
